The sets can be either a triplet: three cards of the same number and different suits, or a sequence: three cards with sequential numbers and the same suit. When it comes to sequences, the '\"Ace\"' card can count as either 1 or 14. So both the sequences A-2-3 and Q-K-A are valid.",
    "howToPlay2": "Every player starts with 9 cards. The rest of them make the deck. The first player buys one card from the deck. Here you can discard the card you bought and buy another one, or keep that card and discard one from your hand. After that, each player buys and discards one card until one of them can beat the game by making a hand with 3 sets of 3 cards. The players can either buy from the deck, or from the top of the trash, which consists of the cards that the other players discarded. One thing to keep in mind is that, if you buy from the trash, you cannot discard that card until your next turn.",
